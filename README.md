### Hey thereðŸ‘‹
I'm an [electrical engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) student at ]Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), and I've got a real passion for software. I love how my studies in engineering help me understand how things work, but it's writing code that gets me really excited. I enjoy getting my hands dirty with practical projects just as much as I like learning new theories in class.

I'm always up for a chat about new tech, cool projects, or just about anything related to engineering and coding. If you want to talk shop or think we could work on something cool together, feel free to reach out!
